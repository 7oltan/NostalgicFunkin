# Nostalgic Funkin

## Acknowledgements

*Keep in mind that these mods are ported by a couple of nerds with their own life and priorities who just want to contribute **for free.** Don't expect perfect code, performance, insane level of quality from a popular mod.*

*The team members don't necessarily research every mod in existence. Stop assuming we support criminals when our intention has nothing to do with it.*

*Mods who have a big no-no stamp from the majorty of the community are **NOT** welcomed such as Bob and Bosip.*

*Nostalgic Funkin' is going semi-separate the art from the artist (obviously with some exceptions, such as Dreams of Roses from Monika Rebooted).*

*We don't have plans on moving CNE to another engine at the moment.*

## What the funk is Nostalgic Funkin'???

Nostalgic Funkin' is a mod pack aimed at porting most classic mods from three years ago or to be specific, mods from Kade Engine era (with a few exceptions such as Kou V3) that made an impact such as Vs Tricky, Vs Whitty, Vs Tabi, B sides, etc to a more modern engine this mod pack uses which is called Codename Engine.

Main porters are:
MAZ, Null, Tsaku, Bam (bambamlolo), Notbeep-,- (Itzbeepi77), SorbetLover (Toni).
