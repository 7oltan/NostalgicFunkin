# Acknowledgements/things to know

*Keep in mind that these mods are ported by a couple of nerds, teens, or kids with their own lives and priorities who just want to contribute **for free.** Don't expect perfect code, performance, or an insane level of quality from a popular mod.*

*The team members don't necessarily research every mod in existence. Stop assuming we support criminals when our intention has nothing to do with it.*

*Mods who have a big no-no stamp from the majority of the community are **NOT** welcome, such as Bob and Bosip.*

*Nostalgic Funkin' is going to semi-separate the art from the artist (obviously with some exceptions, such as Dreams of Roses from Monika Rebooted).*

*We credit the original creators for the sake of crediting their work, controversial or not. It doesn't directly mean we support said creators.*

*We don't have plans on moving CNE to another engine at the moment.*

# What the funk is Nostalgic Funkin'???

## Contribution
I can't explain Codename Engine itself as that needs a whole wiki, so I recommend you to observe the files yourself.

But here are some cool stuff to make navigating stuff easier:

Because of the near 100 songs in there, I setup tags for them, so you would know which songs belong to what mod.
Here's how to enable it (It's only tested on Windows 10, I dunno about others):

This is also the same for images except the tags part.
They're in separate folders instead, so you can navigate pretty easily.
Like this one which is for character images:
