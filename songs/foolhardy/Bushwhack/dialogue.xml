		Oh… Silly boy! It’s you again!
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
		You shouldn’t have come here… I warned you before that it’s dangerous to wander in the dark.
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
		And yet you walked straight towards the center of the darkness. A foolhardy move, boy.
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
		But bravery has a funny way of betraying people… There’s a big difference between you and I.
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
		The dark makes your world small. It devours your senses and puts you on edge…
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
		But to us? Well… Let’s just say you couldn’t have walked into a worse situation.
	</line>
	<line char="zardy_dark" stay="true">
